## Team Details and Roles (Team # 04): 

### Syed Muhammad Haider Ali Sherazi (Enrolment/Student No: 7219530)

  He has implemented the Charging Station, Charging Simulator, Weather Simulator and Energy Source classes. In which he has completed the functionality of charging stations to the vehicle on the basis of current weather and handled the energy sources allocation.
  
### Tazeen Zahra Kazmi (Enrolment/Student No: 7219531)

## Project Description:

We have developed simulation of the Car charging station with several alternative sources of energy. We have created 2 type of users (Externel and Admin) that can have the preference on the basis of role. Three car charging stations are available that can charge vehicles. Charging one car takes a fixed time 5 seconds in our case. If all places are occupied, the car will not wait for more than 15 minute and will leave the queue. We have simulated the weather conditions (Sunny, Cloudy etc) to log the situation at the charging station and switch between the energy sources. We have simulate the management system for the energy sources that are electric grid and solar in our case.
